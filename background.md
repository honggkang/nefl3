## Federated Learning 
Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where multiple entities (clients) collaborate in solving a machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server or service provider. Each client’s raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred; instead, focused updates intended for immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective. [1]

- Establishing a model exploiting a vast amount of data preserving the privacy
    - Data is stored at local users
    - Local users transmit model parameters instead of raw data
- Applications [2]
    - (Cross-device FL) Smart phones: next-word prediction [3], face detection, and voice recognition [4]
    - (Cross-silo FL) Hospitals: strict privacy practices [5]

## Edge Devices
- Growing amount of edge devices
- A vast amount of data from edge devices
- *Federated learning for on-device AI*

## System Heterogeneity
- Computing power
    - Hardware
        - CPU / GPU / NPU / FPGA / ASIC 
    - Run-time dynamics
- Communications
    - 3G/4G/5G/Wi-Fi
- Memory, battery, cloud-aided / on-device AI …

## Challenges of FL in this Era
- Increasing model size + more heterogeneous devices
- **FL must tolerate heterogeneous systems**
